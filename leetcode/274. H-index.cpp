 Problem:    H-index

 Notes:
 Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, 
 write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

 According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h 
 if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

 For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers in total 
 and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
 Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, 
 his h-index is 3.

 Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

 Hint:
 An easy approach is to sort the array first.
 What are the possible values of h-index?
 A faster approach is to use extra space.
